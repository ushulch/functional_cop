Functional Language Community of Practice Base Repository

This is a "top" level repository, cloning it should clone all our code.

Subprojects are available from separate git repos.

The Functional Community of Practice is a Pearson group built around both learning to use purely functional languages
better and how to integrate high-value functional techniques into our daily practice.
